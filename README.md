# auth0-ring

Integrate with Auth0 from Clojure. This repo contains a middleware and some Ring
handlers that mostly mirror the functionality in
the [official Auth0 Servlet](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-servlet), with the
notable exception that this library implements Auth0 in a completely statelesss
manner (e.g. no sessions).

## Install

Add to `:dependencies` in your project.clj:

```clj
[org.clojars.jduenas/auth0-ring "0.4.6"]
```

## Prerequisites

The middleware and handlers assumes the existence of `:cookies` and
`:query-params` in the Ring request map, meaning you should make sure to enable
the corresponding middlewares:

```clj
(ns your.app
  (:require [ring.middleware.cookies :refer [wrap-cookies]]
            [ring.middleware.params :refer [wrap-params]]))

(def handler (-> your-web-handler
                 wrap-params
                 wrap-cookies))
```

## Usage

The official
Auth0 [Java introduction](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/java)
provides much more details and background on how to use this code, the flow,
related specs and so on.

If you just want the distilled version of how to use this library in Clojure,
read on.

The library includes a middleware that will verify the user's JSON Web Token
(JWT), if any, and deserialize it into `(:user req)`. It does not provide a
middleware for requiring logged in users. It also provides handlers that
implement the authentication callback, add a CSRF token/nonce to the login form,
and implements logout from your app and Auth0.

### Configuration

In order to run the sample code in this repo (and Readme), you will need some
configuration:

```clj
{:domain "yourapp.datacenter.auth0.com"
 :issuer "https://yourapp.datacenter.auth0.com/"
 :client-id "client id"
 :signing-algorithm :hs256
 :client-secret "client secret"
 :base "http://localhost:3000/"
 :scope "openid user_id name nickname email picture"
 :callback-path "/auth/callback"
 :error-redirect "/login"
 :success-redirect "/"
 :logout-handler "/auth/logout"
 :logout-redirect "/"}
```

To run the provided sample code, put this in `resources/config.edn`.

You can see an example of this file in `resources-dev/.example.config.edn`.

### The login page

We'll be using [Auth0's Lock](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock) for logins.
Follow the link to learn how to customize it.

The login page pulls a few values from your configuration, as well as the
`:nonce` from the request. In order to make this available, wrap the handler in
`auth0-ring.handlers/wrap-login-handler`:

```clj
(def login
  (auth0-handlers/wrap-login-handler
   (fn [req]
     {:status 200
      :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
      :body (str "<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Login</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src='https://cdn.auth0.com/js/lock/10.9.1/lock.min.js'></script>
    <script>var lock = new Auth0Lock(
'" (:client-id config) "',
'" (:domain config) "', {
  auth: {
    params: {
      scope: '" (:scope config) "',
      state: 'nonce=" (:nonce req) "&returnUrl=" (get-in req [:query-params "returnUrl"]) "'
    },
    responseType: 'code',
    redirectUrl: window.location.origin + '" (:callback-path config) "'
  }
});

lock.show();</script>
  </body>
</html>")})))
```

Then create your web handler:

```clj
(ns auth0-clj.app
  (:require [auth0-ring.handlers :as auth0]
            [auth0-ring.middleware :refer [wrap-token-verification]]
            [ring.middleware.cookies :refer [wrap-cookies]]
            [ring.middleware.params :refer [wrap-params]]))

;; config ...
;; login handler ...

(defn auth-callback [auth0-user]
  ;; Optional hook for when you need to sync user profile details into a local
  ;; database, session etc.
  ;;
  ;; Refer to the Auth0User API:
  ;; https://github.com/auth0/auth0-java-mvc-common/blob/master/src/main/java/com/auth0/Auth0User.java
  (println (.getUserId auth0-user)))

(defn web-handler [req]
  (let [callback-handler (auth0/create-callback-handler config :on-authenticated auth-callback)
        logout-callback-handler (auth0/create-logout-callback-handler config)
        logout-handler (auth0/create-logout-handler config)]
    (case (:uri req)
      "/login" (login-handler req)
      "/auth/callback" (callback-handler req)
      "/auth/logout" (logout-callback-handler req)
      "/logout" (logout-handler req)
      "/favicon.ico" {:status 404})))

(def handler (-> #'web-handler
                 (wrap-token-verification config)
                 wrap-params
                 wrap-cookies))
```

After going through the login, you should now see `(:user req)` in your web
handlers.
